Current Needs and Game Plan

As a group, we are separating the goals of completing multiple models by groups influenced by an individual's learning style, knowledge, and times available.  

_Goal_:
  - To develop an understanding of how we can monitor earthquakes while efficiently opening an alarm monitoring system that identifies reduced costs and resources while maximizing effectiveness.

_Models_:
  - Epidemic-Type Aftershock (ETAS) Model
  - Magnitude Alarm Model
  - Stark Model

_Group Goals:_
  - Horizontal:
    - To complete an analysis of all three models, ease communication between the Curators and Visualizers.  With the Curators, we need to let them know we need a data set of earthquakes with all variables set up as a data frame associated with earthquakes.  In our portion of the project, we will be manipulating the data to produce an analysis of the multiple models and set of information as an output for the visualizers to use.  Within our group, three sub-groups have formed to accomplish certain goals.
  - Group 1: 
    - To recheck our peers' work, maintain compatibility within each portion of our project, and coordinate between the Curators and Visualizers.  Writing up the step-by-step instructions to complete the analysis properly and relaying necessary anticipated needs between groups will help to produce a reproducible set of code. Primarily working during the week and remotely as individuals.
  - Group 2 & 3:
    - A combination of individuals with extensive computer programming knowledge and analytical skills that are able to work on the weekends primarily as a group.  Three models will be evaluated with the data frame given to Group 1 by the Curators.
